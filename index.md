bio: I like to build stuff
---

I graduated from [**Yale-NUS College**](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/)
in 2023 with a BSc (Honors) in Mathematical, Computational and
Statistical Science (Focus in Computer Science). I wrote my research
thesis [*Concurrent Structures and Effect Handlers: A Batch made in
Heaven*](/assets/pdf/Koon-Wen-Lee-Capstone.pdf) under [Dr Ilya
Sergey](https://ilyasergey.net/) which has been extended and published
to *SPLASH 2024* as [*Concurrent Data Structures Made
Easy*](/assets/pdf/concurrent-structures-made-easy). I've also
participated in the [Pembroke International Exchange Programme Fall
2023](https://www.pem.cam.ac.uk/international-programmes), studying
Mathematics and Linguistics at the [**University of
Cambridge**](https://www.cam.ac.uk/)

I currently work at [**Ahrefs**](https://ahrefs.com/) as a mid-end
developer. Previously I was a software engineering intern with
[**Tarides**](https://tarides.com/),
[**Bytedance**](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) and
[**Thryft**](https://thryft.asia/). During which, I have worked on
projects varying from building high-level application services,
open-source libraries/tooling and software that interacts with
low-level embedded systems.

I am based in **Singapore** but have studied in the **UK** and worked
previously in **France** and **Japan**. I presented a talk on [Porting
Mirage onto RIOT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeejZO7A9Lw) at the
[RIOT 2022 Summit](https://summit.riot-os.org/2022/) in Hamburg,
**Germany**.

When I have time, I try to contribute to the OCaml ecosystem by
working on open source projects. I wrote
[obatcher](https://github.com/koonwen/obatcher/) library based on my
thesis. I also maintain
[uring-trace](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/uring-trace/) and
[ocaml-libbpf](https://github.com/koonwen/ocaml-libbpf/)

I'm interested in Operating Systems, Parallel Programming and
Compilers.
