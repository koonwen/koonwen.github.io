bio: "Hello my name is Koonwen and I like to build stuff...  Instead of Covid, I've caught the functional programming bug and now spend a lot of time holed up writing OCaml. On the top of my list of things that I find greater than sliced bread: we have Operating Systems, Compilers and Parallel programming."
