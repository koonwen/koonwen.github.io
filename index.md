bio: Hello, my name is Koonwen and I like to build stuff.
---

I graduated from [**Yale-NUS College**](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/)
in 2023 with a BSc (Honors) in Mathematical, Computational and
Statistical Science (Focus in Computer Science). I wrote my research
thesis [*Concurrent Structures and Effect Handlers: A Batch made in
Heaven*](/assets/pdf/Koon-Wen-Lee-Capstone.pdf) under [Dr Ilya
Sergey](https://ilyasergey.net/). I also participated in the [Pembroke
International Exchange Programme Fall
2023](https://www.pem.cam.ac.uk/international-programmes), studying
Mathematics and Linguistics at the [**University of
Cambridge**](https://www.cam.ac.uk/)

I have worked previously at [**Ahrefs**](https://ahrefs.com/),
[**Tarides**](https://tarides.com/),
[**Bytedance**](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) and
[**Thryft**](https://thryft.asia/) as a software engineering
intern. During which, I have worked on projects varying from building
high-level application services all the way down to low-level embedded
systems.

I am based in **Singapore** but have worked previously in **France** and
**Japan**. I presented a talk on [Porting Mirage onto
RIOT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeejZO7A9Lw) at the [RIOT 2022
Summit](https://summit.riot-os.org/2022/) in Hamburg, **Germany**.

When I have time, I try to contribute to the OCaml ecosystem by
working on open source projects. Currently, I am writing
[obatcher](https://github.com/koonwen/obatcher/) library and a
[iouring_tracer](https://github.com/koonwen/iouring_tracer/).

My current interests are in Operating Systems, Parallel Programming
and Compiler design. Outside of computers, I also enjoy cooking,
skiing and the early morning sun.
