Hello my name is Koonwen and I like to build stuff...  Instead of
Covid, I've caught the functional programming bug and now spend a
lot of time holed up writing OCaml. On the top of my list of things
that I find greater than sliced bread: we have Operating Systems,
Compilers and Parallel programming.
